Flask app code currently imports from and calls to
the SpadesWeb Spades-interface. This is bad, this is wrong.
Badong. 

Spades <-> SpadesWeb <-> WebInterface <-> Flask
				\__________________________/
Above: wrong, bad, no

Spades <-> SpadesWeb <-> WebInterface <-> Flask
Avove: correct, good, yes

Rationale:

	Spades -> Spades Game Instance
		Prior project that 'works', built on top of a card modelling module I wrote to combat ennui. It is a barebones console game.
	SpadesWeb -> Spades-interface
		Since we're keeping most methods and event flow from the original cosole game, we Let It Be by inheriting then only overloading the methods reliant on raw_input() to accept and pass input to the appropriate methods.
		This should simply be a remapping of console dependant functions to act as a clean wrapper.
	WebInterface -> Web-interface
		Passes web form data and events to SpadesWeb. 
		Should implement an event-queue and processing logic.
	Flask app -> App framework
		This should just handle views and all that nonsense.
		Currently some game logic has leaked into this code.
